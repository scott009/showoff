      <p>
        <strong><em>Recovery Dharma is a community of people who support each other by using Buddhist principles and practices to ease the suffering of addiction.</em></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Some of us are Buddhists and some of us are not, but we have found that the ancient practices of mindfulness meditation, ethical conduct, and compassionate self-reflection have improved our lives and supported our recovery.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path sit at the heart of our approach. By practicing mindfulness, cultivating ethical intentions and actions, and working to understand the nature of craving and suffering, many of us have begun to loosen the hold that addiction once had on our lives.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>We are working to create clear, accurate, and culturally grounded translations that help people feel welcomed and understood in their own language. We recognize a simple truth: recovery becomes more accessible when teachings are offered in the languages people use every day.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>We would be grateful for any opportunity to collaborate with sanghas, monastics, translators, and recovery practitioners across the globe. Our hope is that these translations will open new doorways for connection, healing, and shared practice.</em>

          The English edition of the Recovery Dharma book is the foundation of the entire translation project.
          All translated versions begin here. This source expresses the core teachings, the Four Noble Truths,
          the Eightfold Path, our community principles, and the personal stories that guide people in recovery.

            Each language team works from a structured Translation Master. These pages are designed to support
            careful, human-guided translation by presenting the English source and the draft translation side by
            side. Volunteers can review, correct, and refine each paragraph, helping us ensure accuracy,
            clarity, and cultural sensitivity.

        This translation project is an expression of community care. Every reviewed paragraph, every suggested
        correction, and every shared insight helps someone, somewhere, take a step toward healing and
        connection. By working together across languages and cultures, we strengthen the foundation of
        Recovery Dharma and open the door to people who may be encountering these teachings for the first
        time.
      </p>

      <p>

        translator, a monastic advisor, a community member, or a supporter, your presence makes this work

        community.
